# vista
This is a repository for the 'vista' package in R (see documentation site [here](https://fate-spatialindicators.github.io/vista/)). The name 'vista' stands for 'Visualizing and Inspecting SpatioTemporal Analyses'. Output from nearly all spatial or spatiotemporal models may be used as data input, and a series of plots are generated from the predicted and residual values. Examples are based on `sdmTMB` and `mgcv` -- though lots of other model frameworks may be used.
